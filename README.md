# ❤️ Heart Attack Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project predicts the risk of a heart attack using health-related data. Multiple machine learning models were trained and compared, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest (with GridSearchCV tuning), LightGBM, and XGBoost. The final Random Forest model was selected based on its performance.
